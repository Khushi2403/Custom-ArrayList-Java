Custom‑ArrayList‑Java
A custom implementation of Java’s ArrayList built from scratch to demonstrate and understand the internal workings of dynamic arrays and collection mechanics in Java.

Overview
This project contains a basic implementation of the ArrayList data structure in Java. It mimics key behaviors of Java’s built‑in ArrayList, such as dynamic resizing, element addition, removal, access, and internal storage management — without using Java’s java.util.ArrayList. This is great for learning how dynamic arrays work under the hood.

The implementation includes:
1. A generic dynamic array (MyArrayList)
2. Support for resizing when capacity is reached
3. Adding elements
4. Accessing elements by index
5. Removing elements
6. A driver program to test functionality
